# Carb & Egg Timer App

For a fun little project I've started creating a Carbs and Egg Timer App using Maui Blazor



## Built using Maui BLazor

The Maui Blazor framework is a contemporary UI development suite provided by Microsoft, integrating the robust functionalities of .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) with Blazor. This powerful combination facilitates the development of cross-platform applications using C# and .NET. It enables developers to create native applications for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows, as well as web applications, from a single shared codebase. The framework is designed to enhance productivity by allowing code reuse across different platforms, while providing a seamless, high-performance user experience. It is particularly well-suited for building sophisticated, interactive, and visually appealing applications.
